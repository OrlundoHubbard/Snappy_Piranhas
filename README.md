# Hey y'all! Welcome to The Snappy Piranhas collection üêü!

This is a collection of 1,000 generative Piranhas. A collection that I did for fun because I wanted to understand the NFT process from start to finish. 
I literally did the artwork and all.

It literally cost nothing! Maybe just a bit of gas. I minted it on the Polygon (Matic) network so that it wouldn't cost a ton of gas.
